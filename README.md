# Referral Dashboard

Welcome to the **Referral Dashboard**! This project provides a comprehensive, interactive tool for managing and tracking a user-based referral program. It is designed to be a central hub where users can monitor their referral performance, earn exclusive coupons, and help grow the community.

## ✨ Dashboard Features

This dashboard is built with a focus on a clean UI/UX, clear data visualization, and logical organization. Key features include:

* **📊 Comprehensive Stats:** A detailed view of your referral performance, including free vs. paid sign-ups and your total earned points.
* **🔗 Personalized Referral Link:** A unique, short referral link with easy one-click share buttons for various social media platforms.
* **📈 Visual Insights:** Dynamic charts to help you visualize your progress, including monthly points earned, redeemed vs. unredeemed points, and platform-wise performance.

* **📣 Social Media Integration:** A panel to submit and track social media posts for bonus points, complete with a validation status.

## 📌 How the Referral System Works

The referral program is designed to reward users for both direct referrals and social media engagement.

### **Types of Referrals**

* **Free User Referral:** When someone signs up using your link and engages with the free features at least three times, you earn **30 points**.
* **Paid User Referral:** When a referral upgrades to a paid subscription plan, you earn points based on the plan they choose, ranging from **100 to 400 points**. The referred user also gets a **10% discount** on their first subscription.
